This setting contols the Undervolt logic in 4IFIR for frequencies up to 16XX MHz.

The higher the level, the lower the consumption at frequencies below 16xx Mhz.

To test the stability:
1. Set the minimal available CPU frequency.
2. Turn off the Governor (4IFIR Shaitan/Miscellaneous/Frequency Governor).
3. Run some games.
